## Overview
This repository contains the necessary files and the description of the methodology followed for the automatization of mapping and exporting in ArcGIS Pro by using Notebooks.

So what framework has been used?
<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/AlbertGallegoJimenez/map_exporting_automatization/tree/main/images/Framework.PNG"></p>

On the one hand, **ArcGIS Pro** software has been used to build the map template, while the code that automates the process of mapping and exporting in image files has been developed in the form of **Jupyter Notebook**. This is an easy and simple process as the ArcGIS Pro software integrates the use of **Python** codes in the form of notebooks in a very friendly way.

## Contents of the repository
This repository is organised in two folders: 
+ <a href=https://github.com/AlbertGallegoJimenez/map_exporting_automatization/tree/main/data>data folder</a>
